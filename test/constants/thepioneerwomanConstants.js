    name: "French Dip Sandwiches",
    description: "French dip sandwiches are the ultimate comfort food. The crusty bread is piled high with tender beef and golden onions, then served warm with a delicious jus.",
    ingredients: [
      "1 boneless ribeye loin or sirloin (about 4 to 5 pounds)",
      "1 tbsp. kosher salt",
      "2 tbsp. black pepper",
      "1/2 tsp. ground oregano",
      "1/2 tsp. ground thyme",
      "2 whole large onions, thinly sliced",
      "5 cloves garlic, minced",
      "1 whole packet French onion soup mix (dry)",
      "1 can beef consomme",
      "1 c. beef broth or beef stock",
      "1/4 c. dry sherry or white wine (optional)",
      "2 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce",
      "1 tbsp. soy sauce",
      "1 c. water",
      "10 whole crusty deli rolls or sub rolls, toasted"
    ],
    instructions: [
      "Preheat the oven to 475˚ degrees. Tie the piece of meat tightly with a couple of pieces of kitchen twine.",
      "In a small bowl, mix together the salt, pepper, oregano and thyme. Rub the seasoning mixture all over the surface of the beef. Place the beef on a roasting rack in a roasting pan and roast it to medium-rare, about 20 to 25 minutes, until it registers 125˚ degrees on a meat thermometer. (If you want it less pink, go to 135˚.) Remove the meat to a cutting board and cover it with foil.",
      "Place the roasting pan on the stovetop burner over medium-high heat. Add the onions and garlic and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes, until they are soft and golden. Sprinkle in the soup mix, then pour in the consomme, broth, sherry, Worcestershire, soy sauce, and water. Bring it to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Simmer for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, to develop the flavors. Add more water if it starts to evaporate too much. Pour the liquid through a fine mesh strainer and reserve both the liquid and the onions.",
      "Slice the beef very thin. Pile the beef and caramelized onions on the toasted rolls, then serve with a side of jus."
